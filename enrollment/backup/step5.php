    <h2>Lifeline Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

    <p class="fine-print" style="height:100px;overflow:scroll;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px;">
        Lifeline benefits are federal benefits and Applicants that make false statements in order to obtain the Lifeline
        benefit can be punished by fine or imprisonment, de-enrollment or can be barred from the program. Only one Lifeline
        service is available per household. A household is defined, for purposes of the Lifeline program, as any individual or group of
        individuals who live together at the same address and share income and expenses. A household may not receive
        multiple Lifeline benefits from multiple providers. A violation of the one-per-household requirement constitutes
        a violation of the Federal Communication Commissions rules and will result in de-enrollment from the program,
        and could result in criminal prosecution by the United States government. The Lifeline benefit may be applied to
        either one landline or one wireless number, but cannot be applied to both. Note that not all Lifeline services
        are currently marketed under the name Lifeline.
